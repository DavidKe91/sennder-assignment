## About the project
```
Throughout the project I have left comments explaining my thought process for the functionality for the app.

For the testing portion of the assignment, I used Cypress Test Runner to test the funtionality of the overall app loading (ui-init.spec.js), input validation (input.spec.js), modal results (modal.spec.js) and a basic responsive test (viewport.spec.js).

I attempted a more indepth test on the vuex state mutations, but I had quite a lot of difficulty accessing the state from within Cypress.
